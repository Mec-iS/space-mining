# A model of Solar System resources

The model is meant to be the base of a game that leverage these concepts:
* [The multi-armed bandit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit): balancing between exploration and exploitation
* the model can be integrated with predictions using TensorFlow, see [this example](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-ai-duet) for the usage of TF as a service using Flask.
